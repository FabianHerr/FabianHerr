# Hi 👋 I'm Fabian Herrera

🌟 **About Me**  
I’m a **Software Engineering student at McGill University** (with a Minor in Entrepreneurship).  
I love turning ideas into real projects — whether that’s a full-stack app, a machine learning model, or just something fun I built to learn.  
I’m curious, creative, and always looking for ways to push my skills further.
